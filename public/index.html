        <h2>The Truth of Truck Driving</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
                The occupations often holding the most respect are often doctors, firefighters, soldiers etc.
                because those people are believed to help and save others.
                What people don’t realize is that trucking helps keeps the entire world running while saving many
                lives as well; in 2015 alone, they transported a daily average of about 49.3 million tons of freight,
                including medical supplies, food, water supplies, and daily products that we not only want, but need.
                See <a class="smooth-scroll" href="#importance">Importance</a> for more.
                <br>
                And yet, the general public holds a drastically negative view of trucking, commonly classifying it
                as an undesirable and low status career, while also maintaining harmful stigmas and stereotypes
                about truckers themselves. How is that possible? Two words: the media.
                <br><br>

            <tr>
              <td class="text-content" id="movie-text">
                Many movies, shows, or articles have played a large role in creating their bad public image.
                Truckers are most often portrayed as rednecks, having little to no education, overweight & dirty,
                drug users, lawbreakers, and dangerous, among other negative titles. The media had no issue
                portraying a criminal trucker in Smokey and the Bandit (1977), or as a murderous and psychotic
                driver in Joy Ride (2001).

              </div> 
              <div class="face back"> 
                <b>Truth:</b><br>Accidents involving trucks receive way more media coverage than car collisions because they are more likely to result in fatalities. Therefore, more attention is placed on the small percentage of negligent truckers and cannot define the entire population of drivers. Responsible drivers significantly outnumber the other, not to mention all the accidents where the trucks aren’t at fault but get the blame anyhow.

              </div> 
              <div class="face back"> 
                <b>Truth:</b><br>While there are truckers that deal with weight or hygiene issues, many people in other careers deal with the same problems without being on the road for 14 hours a day and away from home for long periods of time. It’s inaccurate to let this stereotype represent the trucking population as a whole.

              <b>Sterotype:</b><br>Truck drivers often engage in illicit behavior such as drugs, drinking, and prostitution while on the road.
            </div> 
            <div class="face back"> 
              <b>Truth:</b><br>Most carriers require immediate drug and alcohol testing prior to hiring as well as random testing throughout their company. While prostitution can happen, it isn’t more prevalent in trucking than it is in other professions and in general, illicit behavior such as these can happen anywhere and in any industry. While that doesn’t make it acceptable, it does make it unfair for this specific one to receive this appalling stereotype. The truckers that do use drugs or alcohol often do so to fight the sleepiness or solitude they may experience, as well as to induce their ability to work more. New technology such as Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs) and On-Board Computers (OBCs) restrict drivers to only driving 11 hours a day (8 hours straight before a break) as well as allowing them to connect with their family back home.

        <h2>Driving Overview</h2>
        <h3>Compensation</h3>
        <p>
          In their first year drivers earn on average $35,000.The average salary for an experienced driver (1-2 years) ranges from $45,000 to $55,000.
        </p>
        <h3>CDL Process</h3>
        <p>
          The process for obtaining a Commercial Drivers License (CDL) is very similar to getting your standard drivers license. 
          There are optional classroom and behind-the-wheel programs that can be valuable in helping you learn to safely manuver the vehicle.
          The requirements for a CDL are: a written <b>general knowledge exam</b>, any <b>additional written exams</b> specific to the vehicle you will be driving, and a basic <b>road test</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You only need to be 18 years old to get a Class A CDL, which will allow you to drive within state until you are 21. 
          The test only costs $24.25 for those under 24 years old. This gives young drivers the chance to get valuable practice 
          closer to home before they go on longer trips.
