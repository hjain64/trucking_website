          <h2>The Truth of Truck Driving</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            The occupations often holding the most respect are often doctors, firefighters, soldiers etc.
            because those people are believed to help and save others.
            What people don’t realize is that trucking helps keeps the entire world running while saving many
            lives as well; in 2015 alone, they transported a daily average of about 49.3 million tons of freight,
            including medical supplies, food, water supplies, and daily products that we not only want, but need.
            See <a class="smooth-scroll" href="#importance">Importance</a> for more.
            <br>
            And yet, the general public holds a drastically negative view of trucking, commonly classifying it
            as an undesirable and low status career, while also maintaining harmful stigmas and stereotypes
            about truckers themselves. How is that possible? Two words: the media.

                Truck drivers are negligent and dangerous on the road.

              <div class="face back">
                <b>Truth:</b>
                <br>
                Accidents involving trucks receive way more media coverage than car collisions because they are more likely to result in fatalities.
                Therefore, more attention is placed on the small percentage of negligent truckers and cannot define the entire population of drivers.
                Responsible drivers significantly outnumber the other, not to mention all the accidents where the trucks aren’t at fault but get the blame anyhow.

                While there are truckers that deal with weight or hygiene issues, many people in other careers deal with the same problems without being on the road for 14 hours a day and away from home for long periods of time.
                It’s inaccurate to let this stereotype represent the trucking population as a whole.

                Most carriers require immediate drug and alcohol testing prior to hiring as well as random testing throughout their company.
                The truckers that do use drugs or alcohol often do so to fight the sleepiness or solitude they may experience, as well as to induce their ability to work more.
                New technology such as Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs)  and On-Board Computers (OBCs) restrict drivers to only driving 11 hours a day as well as allowing them to connect with their family back home.
                This behavior isn’t more prevalent in trucking more than other industries.

              Sure, some might fit the negative stereotype, but how would you feel if people viewed you the same as your one bad coworker?

        <h2>Opportunities</h2>
        <p>The trucking industry offers many opportunities that many people aren’t aware of. Read below to see what trucking could provide for you.</p>
        <h2>Under 21</h2>
        <p>
          At this time you have to be 21 in order to drive outside of state lines even with your CDL, but if you already know you’re not going to college, 
          keep trucking in mind for when you are 21 so you can make a good amount of money without having a degree. If you are going to college and worry 
          about paying back your loans, truck driving would be a great option to avoid some of that pressure.
        </p>
        <h2>Part Time Opportunities</h2>
        <p>
          Truck driving is a great option for people with free time on their hands and looking for an extra source of income. There is a lot of flexibility 
          in trucking and it would be a good inflow of cash for those who aren’t currently financially satisfied. Trucking is also a very realistic job for 
          people among the retired population. Whether you had planned to work for supplementary funds or not, this industry can do anything from helping 
          you stay on your feet throughout your older years to helping you go on the vacations and trips you’ve always wanted to. Whether it’s extra adventure 
          or extra money you’re looking for, becoming a truck driver can give you a lot - even if its part time or full time.
        </p>
        <h2>Flexibility and Change</h2>
        <p>
          Truck drivers can often set their own rules within their cab giving them the freedom to work how they want. There are no suits required and you 
          can listen to whatever music you want, of course there are coworkers to get on your nerves either. Corporate America isn’t for everyone and trucking 
          is a fantastic industry if you don’t want to be in an office all day. It also is a great entry into the shipping and transportation industry for 
          those who may want to move forward. With this added flexibility, trucking is an exciting option for anyone who is looking for freedom and new experiences.
        </p>
        <h2>An Alternate Path to Security and Stability</h2>
        <p>Driver’s wages are more than twice as high as the federal minimum wage and will allow most to provide for his or her family and live a comfortable 
          lifestyle or help people get back on their feet. After the first year, a driver can easily make between $45,000 and $55,000 a year, on top of this. 
          Due to the high demand for drivers, some companies are even adding on a signing bonus or upping the salary right off the bat. Many people choose not 
          to go to college and opt to start in the workforce right away, and there is nothing wrong with that. Truck driving is a great way to save up for those 
          who are hoping to go to college, for those who did not and do not want to go to college, or those in need of an extra boost.
        </p>
        <h2>So, Is Trucking Right For You?</h2>
        <p>
          Trucking is a career path that fewer and fewer people are considering each day, but it offers many opportunities that more should take advantage of. 
          Truck driving is a way of life where there is camaraderie between drivers and always more to learn. Drivers are currently in extremely high demand 
          and are very important to keeping our country running, for many reasons truck driving is an important option for more people to consider. Truck driving 
          can offer you a lot: a good starting salary, highly sought after, and vital to keeping our country running. It’s a great opportunity for many different 
          groups of people to make a difference while benefiting their own lives. With all of this in mind, it’s time to ask if trucking is right for you.

        <h2>Driving Overview</h2>
        <h3>Compensation</h3>
        <p>
          In their first year drivers earn on average $35,000. The average salary for an experienced driver (1-2 years) ranges from $45,000 to $55,000.
        </p>
        <h3>CDL Process</h3>
        <p>
          The process for obtaining a Commercial Drivers License (CDL) is very similar to getting your standard driver's license.
          There are optional classroom and behind-the-wheel programs that can be valuable in helping you learn to safely maneuver the vehicle.
          The requirements for a CDL are: a written <b>general knowledge exam</b>, any <b>additional written exams</b> specific to the vehicle you will be driving, and a basic <b>road test</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You only need to be 18 years old to get a Class A CDL, which will allow you to drive within state until you are 21.
          The test only costs $24.25 for those under 24 years old. This gives young drivers the chance to get valuable practice
          closer to home before they go on longer trips.
          For more information visit: <a href='https://www.dmv.org/apply-cdl.php'>www.dmv.org</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Types of Drivers</h3>
        <h5>Dry Van Drivers</h5>
		      <p>Single trailer vehicles with non-perishable goods. Common for new drivers.</p>
        <h5>Flatbed Drivers</h5>
          <p>Drivers must secure goods such as vehicles, odd shaped items, military equipment, and oversized freight onto the trailer.</p>
        <h5>Tanker Drivers</h5>
          <p>Transport liquids from gasoline and milk to chemicals, gases and cement. Need to act fast in case of emergency.</p>
        <h5>Refrigerated Freight Drivers</h5>
          <p>Includes medical goods, food, and other refrigerated items. Driver needs to maintain the truck temperature.</p>
        <h5>Freight Haulers</h5>
          <p>A term for any driver that regularly pulls dry van, refrigerated freight, tanker or flatbed.</p>
        <h5>LTL Freight Drivers</h5>
          <p>"Less than truckload" means smaller shipments over shorter distances. Drivers typically unload their own trucks.</p>
        <h5>Local/Regional/OTR</h5>
          <p>Local drivers stay in or near their city. Regional drive around the state. "Over the road" drivers travel across country.</p>
        <h3>Driver Shortage</h3>
          <p>
            Currently there is a driver shortage of around 51,000 drivers. It is expected to grow to over 330,000 drivers by 2024 at the current rate.
            You could be part of the solution. If driving sounds interesting to you sign up for a class today!
