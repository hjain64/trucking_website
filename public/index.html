              <p>
                In their first year drivers earn on average $35,000. The average salary for an experienced driver (1-2 years) ranges from $45,000 to $55,000.

                A commercial driver's license (CDL) is a driver's license required to operate large or heavy vehicles. The requirements for a CDL
                are (1) a writed general knowledge exam, (2) any additional written exams specific to the vehicle you will be driving, and (3) a 
                basic road test.

            What people don’t realize is that trucking helps keeps the entire world running while saving many
            lives as well; in 2015 alone, they transported a daily average of about 49.3 million tons of freight,
            including medical supplies, food, water supplies, and daily products that we not only want, but need.

              <div class="face back">
                <b>Truth:</b>
                <br>
                Accidents involving trucks receive way more media coverage than car collisions because they are more likely to result in fatalities.
                Therefore, more attention is placed on the small percentage of negligent truckers and cannot define the entire population of drivers.
                Responsible drivers significantly outnumber the other, not to mention all the accidents where the trucks aren’t at fault but get the blame anyhow.

                Most carriers require immediate drug and alcohol testing prior to hiring as well as random testing throughout their company.
                The truckers that do use drugs or alcohol often do so to fight the sleepiness or solitude they may experience, as well as to induce their ability to work more.
                New technology such as Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs)  and On-Board Computers (OBCs) restrict drivers to only driving 11 hours a day as well as allowing them to connect with their family back home.
                This behavior isn’t more prevalent in trucking more than other industries.

        <h2>Opportunities</h2>
        <p>The trucking industry offers many opportunities that many people aren’t aware of. Read below to see what trucking could provide for you.</p>
        <h3>Under 21</h3>
        <p>
          At this time you have to be 21 in order to drive outside of state lines even with your CDL, but if you already know you’re not going to college,
          keep trucking in mind for when you are 21 so you can make a good amount of money without having a degree. If you are going to college and worry
          about paying back your loans, truck driving would be a great option to avoid some of that pressure.
        </p>
        <h3>Part Time Opportunities</h3>
        <p>
          Truck driving is a great option for people with free time on their hands and looking for an extra source of income. There is a lot of flexibility
          in trucking and it would be a good inflow of cash for those who aren’t currently financially satisfied. Trucking is also a very realistic job for
          people among the retired population. Whether you had planned to work for supplementary funds or not, this industry can do anything from helping
          you stay on your feet throughout your older years to helping you go on the vacations and trips you’ve always wanted to. Whether it’s extra adventure
          or extra money you’re looking for, becoming a truck driver can give you a lot - even if its part time or full time.
        </p>
        <h3>Flexibility and Change</h3>
        <p>
          Truck drivers can often set their own rules within their cab giving them the freedom to work how they want. There are no suits required and you
          can listen to whatever music you want, of course there are coworkers to get on your nerves either. Corporate America isn’t for everyone and trucking
          is a fantastic industry if you don’t want to be in an office all day. It also is a great entry into the shipping and transportation industry for
          those who may want to move forward. With this added flexibility, trucking is an exciting option for anyone who is looking for freedom and new experiences.
        </p>
        <h3>An Alternate Path to Security and Stability</h3>
        <p>Driver’s wages are more than twice as high as the federal minimum wage and will allow most to provide for his or her family and live a comfortable
          lifestyle or help people get back on their feet. After the first year, a driver can easily make between $45,000 and $55,000 a year, on top of this.
          Due to the high demand for drivers, some companies are even adding on a signing bonus or upping the salary right off the bat. Many people choose not
          to go to college and opt to start in the workforce right away, and there is nothing wrong with that. Truck driving is a great way to save up for those
          who are hoping to go to college, for those who did not and do not want to go to college, or those in need of an extra boost.
        </p>
        <h3>So, Is Trucking Right For You?</h3>
        <p>
          Trucking is a career path that fewer and fewer people are considering each day, but it offers many opportunities that more should take advantage of.
          Truck driving is a way of life where there is camaraderie between drivers and always more to learn. Drivers are currently in extremely high demand
          and are very important to keeping our country running, for many reasons truck driving is an important option for more people to consider. Truck driving
          can offer you a lot: a good starting salary, highly sought after, and vital to keeping our country running. It’s a great opportunity for many different
          groups of people to make a difference while benefiting their own lives. With all of this in mind, it’s time to ask if trucking is right for you.

        <h2>Importance</h2>
        <h3>Truck Drivers Run America</h3>
        <p>
          Our country is constantly growing and somehow we have been doing a good job keeping up with it.
          As the country grows, more is needed.
          More goods, materials, resources, you name it.
          With this rapid growth and the consistent high demand for goods, how do we keep up with it?
          It doesn’t magically happen on it’s own.
          The answer is truck drivers.
        </p>
        <h4><b>Transportation</b></h4>
        <p>
          Without truck drivers, the movement of consumer goods would be extremely limited.
          Did you know that 80% of consumer goods are transported by trucks?
          The trucking industry is a vital part of our economy that most Americans take for granted.
          Think about what you do, use, and eat on a daily basis.
          Chances are most of those things have been loaded in and loaded out of a truck.
          Most people do not realize how different their lives would be without this industry.
        </p>
        <h4><b>Economic Collapse</b></h4>
        <p>
          Trucks help your companies grow and move at a steady pace as well as the whole nation.
          Without the help of truck drivers, you can say goodbye to globalization.
          The American economy and other economies around the world would be completely destroyed with nothing to move the imports and exports.
          Major manufacturers would have to shut down assembly lines due to the lack of components, leaving thousands of people without jobs.
        </p>
        <img src="img/truck_ad1.png" id="truck_ad_1">
        <h4><b>Vulnerable Communities and Companies</b></h4>
        <p>
          If a truck stops, businesses will be greatly affected within a short 24 hours.
          For example, if there is a natural disaster such as a hurricane or earthquake,
          brave men and women drivers leave their families and risk their lives to make sure communities get their much-needed supplies.
          If the trucking industry shut down, gas stations would soon run out of fuel,
          grocery stores would run low on food and hospitals would not have access to medicine they need in order to save lives and give people the gift of having their loved ones alive and healthy.
        </p>
        <h4><b>Tanked Health Conditions</b></h4>
        <p>
          Between scarce health supplies as well as food and water shortages, America would sink.
          Without truck drivers, we can’t have what we need, fast.
          The environment would even slowly become polluted with trash left on the streets and in waterways.
          This is not the pretty picture we would like to see, but, it is the true reality of the way we would live without truck drivers help.
          Trucking makes the world a healthier, cleaner, and better place to live and we truly could not survive without them.
        </p>
        <h4><b>MAKE A DIFFERENCE</b></h4>
        <p>
          America relies on the trucking industry and <b>America needs drivers.</b>
          Open the doors to your future today and help not only make a positive change in this world but steer us away from the scary reality we could face.

        <h2>Future</h2>
        <p>
          A safer, greener future is on the horizon for the trucking industry.
           With the advent of electric vehicles, electric trucks are right around the corner.
           Strategies like platooning are being used to further reduce fuel use.
           Video intelligence, combined with safety analytics are being utilized to keep all drivers on the road safer.
           Partial and full automation will aid in this effort and save lives on the road.
        </p>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#electric"><h4>Electric Trucks</h4></button>
        <div id="electric" class="collapse">
          Electric trucks are already in the market, but they are not quite at the capabilities for the transport industry to fully embrace them.
          Currently, about 100 mile range electric trucks are already in the market.
          Tesla unveiled their electric truck in November of 2017, with the promise of a 500 mile range before recharging.
          They say production will start in 2019, and if their claim of 500 miles is accurate, it will revolutionize the trucking industry.
          Speculation and skepticism are rampant about the Tesla trucks, but even 60% of the promised 500 miles would be a huge improvement when a majority of freight moves less than 250 miles.
          <br>
          Other electric options have been announced or unveiled as well.
          Daimler, out of Germany, has unveiled a 250 mile range electric truck which it plans to have out in early access customers hands by the end of 2018, with volume production planned for 2021.
          Nikola Motor Company unveiled a hydrogen-electric truck with claims of being able to travel 1,200 miles on a tank of hydrogen.
          These are supposed to be market ready by 2020.
          <br>
          The future of electric trucks is bright and they will be leading the world into the future of electric vehicles.
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#platoon"><h4>Platooning</h4></button>
        <div id="platoon" class="collapse">
          Platooning is a strategy implemented by companies to electronically link trucks up one after another.
          This way while driving on the highway, the trucks travel at the same speed and also break at the same time so they are always close behind one another.
          This allows the following trucks to use a lot less fuel, saving on CO2 emissions.
          All of these trucks still need drivers in them, therefore, this optimization of fuel use has no impact on the job market.
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#vidintel"><h4>Video Intelligence</h4></button>
        <div id="vidintel" class="collapse">
          Video intelligence is a near 360 degree view of what is happening outside of the truck through mounted cameras.
          This video feed will record based on certain trigger events to capture what really happens in the case of an accident.
          This is to protect the driver from wrongful accusations as truck drivers are usually just assumed to be the ones at fault of an accident.
          Video intelligence makes sure that the truck driver will not be falsely blamed, which protects not only the driver, but the company.
          This is a shift of thinking in the industry; before, cameras were being mounted in the cab to watch the trucker’s driving but now it’s watching the actual event.
          Video intelligence also pairs with vehicle engine data to provide safety analytics.
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#safetyanalytics"><h4>Safety Analytics</h4></button>
        <div id="safetyanalytics" class="collapse">
          Safety Analytics, using data from the vehicle engine and video intelligence, can provide driver coaching opportunities which help to improve safety for everyone on the road.
          This is hugely beneficial for truck drivers so that they can stay safe on the road.
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#autonomous"><h4>Autonomous Trucks</h4></button>
        <div id="autonomous" class="collapse">
          Autonomous trucks are the future of the transportation industry.
          However, while some experts say it’s 10 years down the road, others say its 30 and some say full autonomy won’t ever happen.
          In any case, autonomy in some form is the future of trucking.
          What does this mean for truck drivers?
          A popular model for self-driving trucks is the transfer hub model.
          The transfer hub model would have autonomous trucks driving long haul routes between transfer hubs, and human drivers driving locally between the destination and the transfer hub.
          A study done by Uber on the transfer hub model for self-driving trucks saw an increase in jobs for truck drivers, but on a more local level so that drivers can spend more time at home.
          A swedish company, Einride, is removing the cab of the truck, having the truck drive itself for the long haul routes and having truck drivers drive remotely when they get close to the final destination.
          <br>
          Automation is the future of the trucking industry, though in what form exactly is still unknown.
          In any case, jobs for truck drivers will not be going away anytime soon.
